# Parallel_Compute

An educational example demonstrating domain decomposition and parallel computing using Python.

## Description

This project visualizes a 2D domain split into quadrilateral elements — a basic concept used in finite element methods and parallel computing environments like MPI.

It is intended for illustrating how computational domains can be divided and labeled for multi-process workloads. Two different methods - direct Schur method and alternating Schwarz method has been implemented in the code. 

## Finite Element Domain
